# Academic-Inkscape: Extensions for plot manipulation
A set of Inkscape extensions designed for modifying scientific graphics

This repository contains two Inkscape extensions designed for plot modification. The first, Flatten Plots, eliminates much of the structure generated by common vector graphics plotting programs. The second, Scale Plots, can be used to change the size or aspect ratio of a plot without modifying its text. It is not as flexible as doing the same modification in the original plotting program, but is still much easier than doing the same thing manually.

# Installation
